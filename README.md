# Create-Folders

Folder Creator is a simple Python script that allows you to create multiple folders in a specified directory. It uses the **tkinter ** module to open a window that allows you to select a folder, and the  **os ** module to create the folders.

## Getting Started
To use Folder Creator, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website:  **https://www.python.org/downloads/**

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can download the folder_creator.py file from this repository.

## Usage
To use Folder Creator, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded  **folder_creator.py**.

Type the following command to run the script:

 **python folder_creator.py**
The script will open a window that allows you to select a folder. After you have selected a folder, you will be prompted to enter the number of folders you want to create.

The script will create the folders in the specified directory, with names in the format "Folder1", "Folder2", etc.
